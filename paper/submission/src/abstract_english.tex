With the proliferation of connected cars, driving data extracted through telematics is increasingly utilized across various services, such as usage-based insurance and car-sharing. However, in conventional systems, this data is typically stored within closed infrastructures managed by automakers or service providers. This centralized approach leads to data silos and vendor lock-in, preventing users from accessing or controlling the data generated by their own vehicles. Meanwhile, maintaining the authenticity of driving data remains a critical requirement for service providers.
\\
　To address these challenges, this research proposes a novel management and presentation model for connected car data that logically positions the user between the vehicle and the service provider. By leveraging cryptographic techniques, the proposed model ensures data authenticity while empowering users with full access and control over their driving data. To implement this model, we designed a system based on Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), establishing a framework where driving data can be issued, held, and verified across multiple stakeholders.
\\
　We implemented a prototype based on the proposed architecture for a proof-of-concept. The system was evaluated qualitatively in terms of data accessibility, controllability, and authenticity. Furthermore, we assessed its technical feasibility and conducted a comprehensive threat analysis using the STRIDE methodology. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible and successfully reconciles user-centric data control with rigorous data authenticity. This research contributes to the potential realization of an open automotive data ecosystem that is independent of specific vendor infrastructures.
